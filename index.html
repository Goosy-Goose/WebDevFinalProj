                It's normal to spend hours on social media only to leave feeling worse than when you started: <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-health/social-media-and-mental-health.htm">Social Media and Mental Health</a>
                <br><br>
                It doesn't mean you have to feel that bad.
                <br><br>
                Do what is best for your own mental health. Sometimes that means doing the hard thing and just stepping away from social media for a moment.<br>
                You can try finding other non-work things to do instead.
                <br><br>
                No matter what, I believe in you!
